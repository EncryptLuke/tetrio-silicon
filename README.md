# tetrio-silicon
A TETR.IO desktop client with native support for Apple Silicon.
- does anyone even use this thing besides me lol
- literally all of the credit goes to https://github.com/o5k, i did like nothing special
- if you need any help, ping me in the tetrio discord server under Luke .-.#4500 or dm me, i'll get back to you s soon as i can
## If you'd still like to use the official client, go to https://tetr.io/about/desktop/



the next build of tetrio-silicon will have the latest version of tetrio-plus (at the time of release) built in, because the official version of tetrio plus seems to struggle with this build. the electron version will also be bumped to 27.0.0
